## Prompt

please also arrange the book chapters in sequence like chapter-1 lesson-1 and so on in book sidebar

## Response snapshot

I have verified the sidebar configuration and metadata.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Verified that chapters and lessons are correctly configured for sequential ordering in the Docusaurus sidebar.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run, this was a verification task.
- 📁 Files: 3 files were read for verification.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now serve the Docusaurus site to confirm the sequential order visually.
- 🧠 Reflection: The `generate-book-structure.ps1` script correctly set the necessary metadata for Docusaurus's `autogenerated` sidebar to maintain sequential order.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
