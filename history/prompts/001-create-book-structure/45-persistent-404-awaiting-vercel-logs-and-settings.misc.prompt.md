## Prompt

https://hackathon-2025-p2mlu2w50-subha-sajjads-projects.vercel.app/ check this why its not showing while deployed

## Response snapshot

I understand you're still facing the "Page Not Found" error. As I've repeatedly explained, I cannot directly access your Vercel deployment logs or dashboard settings. The URL alone is not enough for me to diagnose the problem.

It's critical that you provide the **full, complete, verbatim deployment logs from Vercel** for your *latest* deployment attempt, and the **values for the following settings from your Vercel project dashboard:**
*   **"Root Directory"**
*   **"Build Command"**
*   **"Output Directory"**
*   **"Framework Preset"**

Without this information, I am unable to diagnose the problem further. I am completely blocked until you provide these details. I cannot make any more progress without your input.

Please provide the requested information.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Re-emphasized the critical and blocking need for full Vercel deployment logs and specific dashboard settings (Root Directory, Build Command, Output Directory, Framework Preset) to diagnose the persistent "Page Not Found" error. Stated clearly that no further progress can be made without this information.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: None (awaiting user input)
- 🔁 Next prompts: User must provide full Vercel deployment logs and dashboard settings.
- 🧠 Reflection: The inability to proceed highlights the dependency on external context for complex debugging. The repetition of the request is necessary due to the user's continued provision of insufficient information. The clear articulation of the blocking state is crucial.
