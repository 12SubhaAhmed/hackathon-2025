## Prompt

check whats th error why its giving page not found on vercel

## Response snapshot

My apologies. I made a mistake in trying to set two tasks as "in_progress".

I have now corrected the todo list. The task `Obtain Vercel deployment logs for detailed analysis` is now correctly marked as `in_progress`.

As previously stated, I need the **full, complete, verbatim deployment logs from Vercel** for your *latest* deployment attempt, and the **values for the following settings from your Vercel project dashboard:**
*   **"Root Directory"**
*   **"Build Command"**
*   **"Output Directory"**
*   **"Framework Preset"**

Please provide these details so I can continue to help you diagnose the "Page Not Found" error.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Re-emphasized the critical need for comprehensive Vercel deployment logs and dashboard settings to diagnose the persistent "Page Not Found" error. Corrected the todo list to reflect the current blocking task.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: None (awaiting user input)
- 🔁 Next prompts: User must provide full Vercel deployment logs and dashboard settings.
- 🧠 Reflection: Persistent "Page Not Found" errors with seemingly correct code point to environment or platform-specific configurations. Access to logs and settings is non-negotiable for effective troubleshooting in such scenarios.
